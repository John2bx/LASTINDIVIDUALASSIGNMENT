# LASTINDIVIDUALASSIGNMENT
Final Individual Assignment For Codaisseur

This was My final assignment for Codaisseur. 

Front-end app build with react and redux and a back-end build with Node and TypeORM. 

It contains a Batch/Class page were Classes can be added and deleted and assigned a number.

It contains a Batch page where students are listed and can be edited, deleted and added. We can also see the picture of the student if they have one.


An algorith makes it possible to choose a random student to ask a question. But not entirely random. There is in percentage more chance to ask
a random student that was evaluated badly than good. 

Then there is a student page were we can see, add, and evaluate a student. 

This project is functional but still in progress!
